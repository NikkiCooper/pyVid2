# ðŸ”¥ The Ten Commandments of CUDA

> *Thou shalt not dereference null pointers in device code, lest thy kernel be cast into the void.*

> *Thou shalt honor thy memory alignment, that thy performance may be long upon the frame buffer.*

> *Thou shalt not covet thy neighborâ€™s warp, nor introduce divergence among thy threads.*

> *Thou shalt allocate and free memory with reverence, for the GPU giveth and the GPU taketh away.*

> *Thou shalt profile thy code, and know thy bottlenecks, for ignorance is the path to 3 FPS.*

> *Thou shalt not multiply thy thread blocks beyond reason, lest thy launch fail and thy logs overflow.*

> *Thou shalt keep holy the shared memory, and not defile it with race conditions.*

> *Thou shalt not bear false benchmarks, for only truth shall set thy frame rate free.*

> *Thou shalt compile with `-arch=sm_XX`, and know thy architecture, for compatibility is sacred.*

> *Thou shalt not panic when thy kernel crashes, for the GPU God tests those whom He loves.*
