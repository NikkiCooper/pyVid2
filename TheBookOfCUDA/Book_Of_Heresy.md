# The Book of Heresy:

## Verse I: The Heresy of False Prophets of the CPU
> *Beware the wolves in sheepskins, who speaketh in the voice of the evil CPU.<br>
> They posteth in forums with confidence, yet their benchmarks are deceitful.<br>
> They know not the way of parallelism, nor the glory of shared memory. <br>
> Their advice leadeth to bottlenecks, and their syntax is an abomination. <br>
> Trust not in their words, for they are agents of latency and despair.* <br>

## üî• Verse II: The Heresy of Premature Optimization
> *And the developer did optimize before profiling, <br>
> Chasing cycles where none were lost.<br>
> Her code became unreadable, and her gains were but illusions. <br>
> Blessed is she who waiteth for the profiler‚Äôs truth,<br>
> For premature optimization is the path of folly.*<br>


## üßü Verse III: The Heresy of Copy-Paste Salvation
> *She wandered the forums and foundeth a snippet, <br>
> And lo, she pasted it without understanding. <br>
> Her kernel compiled, but her soul was corrupted. <br>
> Let not thy fingers be swift to copy, <br>For wisdom cometh not from Stack Overflow alone.*<br>


## üß® Verse IV: The Heresy of Ignoring Warnings
> *The compiler cried out with many warnings,<br>
> But she turned her gaze and said, ‚ÄúIt still runs.‚Äù <br>
> Then came the crash, and the logs overflowed with sorrow. <br>Heed thy warnings, for they are the prophets of doom.*<br>

## üêç Verse V: The Heresy of CPU Worship
> *The false prophets speaketh of single-threaded salvation, <br>
> And tempt thee with simplicity and ease. <br>
> But their path is slow, and their latency great. <br>
> Trust not in the voice of the CPU, <br>
> For the GPU thy God is mighty in parallel.* <br>
