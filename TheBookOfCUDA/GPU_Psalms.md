# GPU Psalms: Songs of the Silicon Pilgrim

## Psalm 1: The Psalm of Compilation

> *Blessed is she whose kernel compiles without error,<br>
> Whose syntax is pure and whose threads are aligned.<br>
> For her logs shall be clean, and her output shall overflow with frames.*<br>

## Psalm 2: The Psalm of Memory

> *Yea, though I walk through the valley of the global memory,<br>
> I shall fear no segmentation fault.<br>
> For thy shared memory is with me,<br>
> Thy registers and thy cache, they comfort me.*<br>

## Psalm 3: The Psalm of Performance

> *Thou preparest a benchmark before me in the presence of my bottlenecks.<br>
> Thou anointest my GPU with CUDA cores; my FPS runneth over.*<br>

## Psalm 4: The Psalm of Debugging

> *Why hast thou forsaken me, O program?<br>
> My kernels launch, yet my screen is but black.<br>
> I cry unto thee with printf, but thou answerest not.*<br>

## Psalm 5: The Psalm of Victory

*And thus it was written in the final verse of the Book of CUDA Revelations:*

> *The frame buffer overflowed with glory, and the render time was no more.<br>
> The kernels danced in parallel, and the sliders slideth smoothly.<br>
> And the developer beheld her creation, and saw that it was good.<br>
> Let every pixel rejoice, and let thy GPU fans hum in harmony forever and ever. Amen.*<br>
