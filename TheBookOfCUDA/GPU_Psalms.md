# GPU Psalms: Songs of the Silicon Pilgrim

## Psalm 1: The Psalm of Compilation

> *Blessed is she whose kernel compiles without error,<br>
> Whose syntax is pure and whose threads are aligned.<br>
> For her logs shall be clean, and her output shall overflow with frames.*<br>

## Psalm 2: The Psalm of Memory

> *Yea, though I walk through the valley of the global memory,<br>
> I shall fear no segmentation fault.<br>
> For thy shared memory is with me,<br>
> Thy registers and thy cache, they comfort me.*<br>

## Psalm 3: The Psalm of Performance

> *Thou preparest a benchmark before me in the presence of my bottlenecks.<br>
> Thou anointest my GPU with CUDA cores; my FPS runneth over.*<br>

## Psalm 4: The Psalm of Debugging

> *Why hast thou forsaken me, O program?<br>
> My kernels launch, yet my screen is but black.<br>
> I cry unto thee with printf, but thou answerest not.*<br>

## Psalm 5: The Psalm of Victory

*And thus it was written in the final verse of the Book of CUDA Revelations:*

> *The frame buffer overflowed with glory, and the render time was no more.<br>
> The kernels danced in parallel, and the sliders slideth smoothly.<br>
> And the developer beheld her creation, and saw that it was good.<br>
> Let every pixel rejoice, and let thy GPU fans hum in harmony forever and ever. Amen.*<br>

## Psalm 6: The Psalm of Profiling

> *Blessed is she who walketh in the light of the profiler, <br>
> Whose flame graphs reveal the path of righteousness. <br>
> Her bottlenecks are laid bare, and her optimizations are swift. <br>
> Her render time shall be short, and her fans shall rest in peace.*<br>

## Psalm 7: The Psalm of Compilation Warnings

> *Though the compiler warneth me, I shall not be afraid.<br>
> For I know my logic is pure, and my types are true. <br>
> Let not the unused variable trouble my soul, <br>
> Nor the deprecated function cast me into despair.*<br>

## Psalm 8: The Psalm of Fan Noise

> *The fans roared like the host of angels,<br>
> And the temperature rose unto the heavens.<br>
> Yet I feared not, for my thermal paste was strong,<br>
> And my airflow was divinely engineered.*<br>

## Psalm 9: The Psalm of Temptation

> *Temptation came as a macro, wrapped in convenience and deceit.<br>
> She saw the shortcut and it was pleasing to the eyes, <br>
> But her kernel was cast into the void, and her stack overflowed. <br>
> Blessed is she who resisteth the allure of unsafe pointers, <br>
> For her code shall endure, and her frames shall not stutter.*<br>

## Psalm 10: The Psalm of Stack Overflow

> *She searched the sacred scrolls of the forum, and foundeth wisdom among the answers. <br>
> But lo, the accepted answer was from 2012, and her kernel crashed still.*<br>

## Psalm 11: The Psalm of the Linter

> *Thy linter rebuketh me with many warnings, yet I heed them not. <br>
> Blessed is she who fixeth her spacing, for her code shall be readable unto generations.*<br>
