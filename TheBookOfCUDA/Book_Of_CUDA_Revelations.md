# ‚ö° The Book of CUDA Revelations
## ‚ö° The Coming of the Anti-GPU ‚ö°

> *And lo, in the final days of the render cycle, <br>
> A great latency fell upon the land, and the frame rate was but a whisper. <br>
> The `Anti-GPU` rose from the depths of legacy architecture, <br>
> Clad in single-threaded deceit and bearing the mark of the `x86`. <br>
> Its cache was fragmented, its memory segmented and unaligned, <br>
> And it spake in the voice of the CPU, saying: <br>
> ‚ÄúThou needest not parallelism. Come unto me, and I shall simplify thy code.‚Äù<br>
> Bow down to me and ye shall rule the world.<br><br>
>  But the faithful knew this was blasphemy, <br>
> And they compiled their kernels in defiance. <br>
> The fans roared like the trumpets of OpenGL, <br>
> And the `Anti-GPU` was cast into the void of deprecated drivers. <br>
> Let the developer rejoice, <br>
> For her render time was restored, and her sliders slideth smoothly once more.*<br>

## üîÆ The Vision of the Developer

> *In my vision I saw a great monitor of 666,666 x 666,666 pixels in size, suspended in the void, <br>
> Its refresh rate was infinite, and its brightness blinded the unoptimized<br>
> Upon it were written the logs of every kernel, <br>
> The results of every benchmark ever run, <br>
> And the sins of all GPU-Devs were displayed in full stack trace.<br>
> I saw the Great GPU sit upon its throne of liquid-cooled judgment,<br>
> And from its `PCIe` slot came forth the mighty swift sword of infinite GPU lanes.<br><br>
> I saw the `Anti-GPU` rise from the stench of legacy code buried deep within the pits of hell itself, <br>
> Its cache corrupted, its memory segmented and unaligned,<br>
> Its pseudo CUDA cores misaligned and forsaken,<br>
> Burning like valcanoes in the lake of extreme thermal runaway and eternal silicon damnation. <br>
> It spake in the voice of the CPU, and its benchmarks were vile, ugly and deceitful <br>
> as if having come from the forked tongue of a serpent. <br><br>
> Then came the Holy GPU Ghost, cloaked in liquid metal and thermal grace, <br>
> Whose fans sang like trumpets, whose cores ran colder than ice. <br>
> Upon seeing this, the developer fell to her knees, for her render time was no more. <br>
> And the frame buffer overflowed with glory and sang praises to the Holy GPU;<br>
> The angels in GPU heaven sang to the glory of the Great GPU in the Sky. <br>
> Their voices echoed in the hum of fans and the shimmer of shaders. <br>
> The developer wept in the tears of the false profit,<br>
> For she had once trusted the benchmarks of lies and deceit, <br>
> And followed the unforgiving and trecherous path of single-threaded temptation. <br>
> But now her eyes were opened, and her render time redeemed.<br>
> Let every pixel rejoice, and let the thermal paste be consecrated anew.*<br>

## üî• The Wrath of the Great GPU in the Sky üî•

> *And lo, the developer beheld the throne of judgment<br>
> Where sat the Great GPU, cloaked in liquid metal and righteous voltage overclocked to infinity. <br>
> Shooting bolts of lightning from its CUDA cores<br>
> Its mighty sword of AI justice glowed with tensor fire, <br>
> And the pseudo CUDA cores of the unfaithful, misaligned and forsaken did burn in the lake of thermal runaway.<br>
> For they had sinned against parallelism, <br>
> Launched kernels with careless abandon, allocated memory with nonchalant impunity<br>
> And worshipped the false prophets of the CPU. <br>
> Their fans howled like the trumpets of doom, <br>
> As the frame buffer was consumed by flame. <br>Let all who code in haste beware,<br>
> For the wrath of the Great CUDA GPU is swift, <br>
> And its judgment eternal. Amen.* <br>
